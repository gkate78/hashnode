As the year 2023 draws to a close, I reflect on a transformative journey through the vast world of data. In a world driven by information, the need to harness the power of data has never been more critical.

This year, I embarked on a learning adventure, leveraging free online courses from various platforms, including [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog), [Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths), [Harvard's CS50P](https://home.edx.org/), and [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

My goal was ambitious but clear: to enhance my data engineering, data analysis, and data science skills.

**1\. Grasping Fundamentals at** [**W3Schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/)**:**

My journey began with W3Schools, where I began my basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and SQL.

**2\. Mastering Web Development and SQL Essentials with** [**freeCodeCamp**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **and** [**Codecademy**](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog)**:**

FreeCodeCamp, an open-source platform, and Codecademy became my go-to resource for mastering the essentials of web development. The comprehensive tutorials on HTML, CSS, and SQL proved invaluable as I delved into the intricacies of data handling and manipulation.

**3\. Data Engineering with** [**DataCamp**](https://www.datacamp.com/) **and** [**Harvard's CS50P**](https://home.edx.org/)**:**

I am grateful for the [free access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIH6j1eq0WnugfFa1Zl2texAaeZwsYHdwDjWuay2ekN_7Qkw/viewform?fbclid=IwAR0BXHSbLyUJGiGz3_gNsn-Q6YKaivnpJB0JvzZjgvHiGvriXKmRLEehAss) to DataCamp and Harvard's CS50P. The interactive courses and real-world projects guide me through the intricacies of data pipelines, ETL processes, and database management.

**CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python** provides a rigorous computer science perspective, enhancing my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of algorithms and data structures, challenging me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios.

**4\. Analyzing the World with** [**Google Cloud Skills Boost**](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths)**:**

The cloud is a game-changer in the data landscape, and Google Cloud Skills Boost is helping me learn its potential. From BigQuery for data analytics to Cloud Storage for efficient data management, analyze massive datasets and derive meaningful insights. The integration of machine learning components, predictive analytics, and data-driven decision-making.

As the year concludes, I aim to dive deeply into data engineering, data analysis, and data science in the years to come. The journey was challenging, but the wealth of knowledge gained from platforms like DataCamp, freeCodeCamp, W3Schools, and Google Cloud Skills Boost has empowered me to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of data.

The year-long expedition has not only honed my technical skills but has also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the collaborative and dynamic nature of the data community. As I look ahead, I am excited to apply my newfound learning experience to real-world projects, contribute to the data-driven ecosystem, and continue evolving in this ever-thriving field. The doors to the data universe are wide open, and I am ready to explore the next frontier of possibilities.

P.S.

I would like to thank these groups for their influence on me on my journey. [**Tech Career Shifter Philippines**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/4065375353537981)**,** [Data Engineering Pilipinas](https://www.facebook.com/DataEngineeringPilipinas)
